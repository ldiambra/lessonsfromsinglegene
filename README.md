I am sharing the Python codes to solve the differential equations in our manuscript
"Simplifications and approximations in a single-gene circuit modeling", published in
Scientific Reports (2024, DOI:10.1038/s41598-024-63265-8).

To run the codes you need to install previously the following libraries:
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
jitcdde
sympy
